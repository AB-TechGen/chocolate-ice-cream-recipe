Easy chocolate ice cream recipe which does not need any ice cream maker and also you do not have to whip it twice or thrice. Just make once, freeze and then enjoy.
The best part of this chocolate ice cream recipe is that there are no ice crystals in the ice cream. You can make this ice cream any time and serve it whenever required. This recipe gives a large block of ice cream. You can even make sundaes or special desserts with this ice cream.
Do use a good quality cocoa powder for the ice cream. about cream, I have used amul whipping cream, which is 30% fat and it did whip till stiff peaks. If using 25% fat cream, then you can whip it till soft peaks. If you add icing sugar in this cream, then you can whip it till stiff peaks. The same recipe can also be made in an ice cream maker. I have used brown sugar in the recipe. You can use regular sugar too.
